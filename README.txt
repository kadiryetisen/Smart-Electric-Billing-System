In the smart electricity bill reporting system project,
the aim is to show the usage amount in kW to the user and convey the instant usage price
in any currency with the algorithm created based on the taxation information 
in the previous month's usage amount.

STEPS
1-) Make sure Python has been installed.
2-) pip install -r requirements.txt (all libraries are imported)
3-) There is a "photos" folder in our code folder. You can try the code with these photos.
4-) If you want to use this code for yourself, get some meter photos and change your tax ratio (138-158)
